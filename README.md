# Five-Stage-Risc-V-Core
I'm in my third semester currently pursuing bachelors in Computer Science at Usman Institute of Technology, Pakistan. Being a trainee @ Micro Electronics Research Lab, I designed a parameterized RISC-V 32-bit Single Cycle Core using functional programming in Scala and Chisel. I've added Five stage Pipelining into my single cycle core to make it more optimized.
